> This folder contains the following notebooks :-
> 1. [Introduction To DeepLearning](https://github.com/TanishB/Facebook_Udacity/blob/master/01_DeepLearning%20With%20PyTorch/01_Intro%20To%20DeepLearning.ipynb) 
In this notebook you'll get introduced to PyTorch & basic mathematics behind neural networks.

> 4. [FASHION MNIST](https://github.com/TanishB/Facebook_Udacity/blob/master/01_DeepLearning%20With%20PyTorch/04_Fashion%20MNIST.ipynb)
MNIST is simple so here you'll build a deep learning model using FashionMNIST dataset, which is a bit complex to train.

> 5. [Inference & Validation](https://github.com/TanishB/Facebook_Udacity/blob/master/01_DeepLearning%20With%20PyTorch/05_Inference%20And%20Validation.ipynb)
In this notebook you'll learn about Validation, overfitting and Dropout(method to prevent overfitting)

> 6. [Saving & Loading Models](https://github.com/TanishB/Facebook_Udacity/blob/master/01_DeepLearning%20With%20PyTorch/06_Saving%20%26%20Loading%20Models.ipynb)
In this notebook you'll learn How to save and load the model as we cannot train the network everytime we need to use it.
