    "Welcome to this tutorial! In the following notebooks you will learn how to provide private predictions. By private predictions, we mean that the data is constantly encrypted throughout the entire process. At no point is the user sharing raw data, only encrypted (that is, secret shared) data. In order to provide these private predictions, Syft Keras uses a library called [TF Encrypted](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted) under the hood. TF Encrypted combines cutting-edge cryptographic and machine learning techniques, but you don't have to worry about this and can focus on your machine learning application.\n",

    "You can start serving private predictions with only three steps:\n",
    "- **Step 1**: train your model with normal Keras.\n",
    "- **Step 2**: secure and serve your machine learning model (server).\n",
    "- **Step 3**: query the secured model to receive private predictions (client). \n",

The idea is to split the model weights and input data into shares, then send a share of each value to the different servers. The key property is that if you look at the share on one server, it reveals nothing about the original value (input data or model weights).\n",

    " - `share`: will secure your model via secret sharing; by default, it will use the SecureNN protocol from TF Encrypted to secret share your model between each of the three TFEWorkers. Most importantly, this will add the capability of providing predictions on encrypted data.\n",
    " - `serve`: this function will launch a serving queue, so that the TFEWorkers can can accept prediction requests on the secured model from external clients.\n",
